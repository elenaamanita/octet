The Cube

The Cube is a puzzle level game. The purpose is to throw all the cubes before you run out of time. 
There are invisible obstacles where you cannot access the cubes in order to throw them, you have to find 
a different path or gain force to attack on them.
The yellow cubes are the enemies. Try not to put them in the corner of the maze, otherwise you won't be able to finish the Level.
